## Credits

This portfolio is based on the open GitHub project
"React Portfolio 2" by Sridhar Chandrasekar:
https://github.com/Sridhar-C-25/react_portfolio_2

The structure, components, sections, styling and content have been
significantly modified to match my own profile, projects
and design preferences.
